Library Management System
Overview
The Library Management System is built using .NET Core, providing a full solution for managing authors, books, borrowers, and book loans. This project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns using modern technologies like Entity Framework Core for database management, AutoMapper for object mapping, Dependency Injection (DI) for managing dependencies, and comprehensive testing for business logic and data layers.
